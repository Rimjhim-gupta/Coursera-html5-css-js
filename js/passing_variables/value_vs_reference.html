<p>
	 Primitives are passed or copied by value and objects are passed or copied by reference. 
	 <br>
	 Copying and passing by value means that the new variable has no relation to the old variable and changing the value in it will not affect the old variable, as opposed to passing or copying by reference. Changing the values in that new variable will affect the values of the old variable from which the object was actually copied.
